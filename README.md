# oimp_homeworks
I had a course called "Basics and Methodology of Programming", where we learnt to write neat C++ code.
Those 3 files are from this course homeworks to show it as my C++ code examples.



Let me write a little about navigation here:

* Integral.cpp
I needed to calculate the fraction integral of some function with Triangle rule or Trapezoidal rule.
Wrote classes RectangleRule and TrapezoidalRule with public inheritance of IntegrationMethod

* MathVector.cpp
I needed to write class for Math Vector (list of numbers) with relevant operations: multiplication with number or another Vector, and addition with Vector.

* MineSweeper.cpp
Rules of Mine Sweeper game: You have field NxM with closed cells. Every cell contains or doesn't contain a bomb.
For every open cell you see amount of bombs in adjacen–µ cells. You need to open all cells without bombs.
So in the project I wrote a class for this game with operations like SetMine and CheckForMinesAround.
